# Necessities

- 3D Avatar
  - Create a 3D model of myself (blender? mixamo for rigging?)
- Animations
  - Need various animations like: sleeping, falling ,transformation, painting etcs
- Threejs
  - Load model into three.js and control the animations based on scroll position
  - ensure smooth transitions
- lighting/scene
  - Find a good theme: lightmode and darkmode?

## Feature planning

1. Skeleton Page & Scrolling logic

- three.js needs a fixed camera
- smooth scrolling detection
- Should test movement based triggers before adding visuals

2. Sprites/character placeholder

- just need a box tbh

3. Transformations

- sleeping, falling, landing, jumping
- Changing clothing styles

4. Art and Animation

- Animate frame swaps (think about spritesheets)

5. Polishing

- need background elements for depth
- lazyloading is a necessity
- hover interactions or subtle effects?
